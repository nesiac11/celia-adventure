# Chapter 3: The Kitchen Incident
<div class="decorative-line"></div>

A few days later, Celia hummed as she prepared another batch of homemade cat food. Just as she was about to finish, a faint rustling caught her attention. 

She turned to see Raya perched on the counter, pawing at a box of freshly made food. 

"What are you doing?" Celia asked, hands on her hips. 

Raya froze mid-motion, caught red-handed. "Oh, this... your house? I had no idea." She avoided eye contact, clearly guilty. 

Celia sighed, shaking her head. "You could have just asked, you know." 

"I am above begging for food," Raya replied, lifting her chin slightly. 

Celia gestured to the mess. "Then what is this?" 

Raya, determined to maintain her dignity, ignored the question. "Since you caught me, I suppose you wouldnâ€™t mind serving me properly." 

Celia rolled her eyes, but there was amusement in her tone. "Alright, alright. Just give me a moment." 

She carefully placed the food onto a clean plate and set it at a dignified height for Raya. 

Raya sniffed, nodded approvingly, and began to eat with delicate, measured bites. 

Celia grinned. "Why? You want to try making it yourself?" 

Raya scoffed. "A chef should always know what goes into a fine meal." 

Celia chuckled. "Well, if you ever want the full recipe, just ask." 

Raya said nothing, merely finishing her meal before leaping off the counter. "Very well. I shall return." 

With that, she disappeared into the shadows once more, leaving Celia shaking her head with a fond smile.
