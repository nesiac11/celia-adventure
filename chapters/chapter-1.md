# Chapter 1: The Enchanted Encounter

<div class="decorative-line"></div>


A little girl skipped through the forest, her shiny Mary Janes making soft crunching sounds on the underbrush. Sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled patterns on the ground like playful fairies dancing in the breeze. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, and the soft buzz of busy bees added a gentle hum to the melody of rustling leaves. 

Celia had a strange feeling—like something was following her. She glanced over her shoulder, but each time, she saw only the flicker of shadows. Her heartbeat quickened. She took a deep breath and spun around swiftly. 

"HA!" she shouted. 

A sleek tuxedo cat leaped into the air, startled. 

"Oh, it's a kitty. Aw, hello there..." Celia cooed. 

The cat shook itself and huffed, flicking its ears in irritation. "My goodness, child, you startled me!" 

Celia gasped. "DID YOU JUST TALK?!" 

The cat narrowed its emerald eyes, tail curling neatly around its paws. "You can understand me? How curious." 

Celia clasped her hands together, barely containing her excitement. "No way! A talking cat!" 

The cat gave a small nod. "It seems you are one of the rare humans with such an ability." 

Celia giggled. "I'm Celia! What should I call you?" 

"You do not have the right to name me," the cat replied, lifting its chin regally. 

Celia pouted. "Why not? I can’t just call you ‘the talking cat.’" 

The cat’s tail flicked once. "Names have power, little one. They are not to be given lightly—especially not by mere human children." 

"But don’t you already have one?" Celia pressed on. 

Ignoring her question, the cat sniffed the air. "You brought something delightful." 

"Oh!" Celia exclaimed, quickly opening her bag. The rich, savory aroma of food drifted between them. 

The cat’s nose twitched eagerly. "That smells quite divine. May I partake?" 

Celia grinned. "Sure! I was going to feed the strays at the market." 

The cat hesitated, then straightened. "I am no stray." 

Celia tilted her head. "Of course! You have a beautiful necklace. You must be lost." 

The cat stiffened. "You can see this?" 

"Yeah! It’s so pretty. Your owner must be someone special." 

The cat scoffed. "No one owns me." A pause. Then, quietly, "You are the first human who can understand me and see my pendant. You are no ordinary girl." 

Celia’s eyes sparkled. "Really? I am honored! Then I should call you something fitting!" 

The cat sighed, licking a paw as if bored. "I told you, child. No one names me." 

Celia tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Hmm… how about Raya? It sounds elegant, just like you!" 

The cat paused mid-lick, her tail giving a slow twitch. "Ridiculous. I refuse." 

"But it suits you!" Celia insisted, a grin stretching across her face. "Raya it is!" 

The cat let out an exasperated sigh but did not argue further. Instead, she merely flicked her tail and turned away. "You are persistent, little one." 

Celia beamed. "That means you like it, doesn’t it?" 

Raya said nothing, merely leaping gracefully into the bushes.
