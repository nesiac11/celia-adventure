# Chapter 5: A Test of Wits 
<div class="decorative-line"></div>

Celia practiced tirelessly under Raya’s guidance, but magic was proving to be much harder than she had imagined. Despite her best efforts, spells fizzled, sparks flew wildly in the wrong direction, and her focus wavered at the worst moments. 

One afternoon, as Celia wiped sweat from her brow, Raya watched her with a look of thinly veiled disapproval. 

“Your form is still lacking,” Raya observed coolly. “Your hands are unsteady, your focus scattered. It is no wonder your magic falters.” 

Celia groaned. “I know that, but it’s hard!” 

Raya sighed. “Magic is not meant to be easy. It is the delicate balance of power and will. You must command it, not plead with it.” 

Celia frowned, determination hardening her features. “Then what am I doing wrong?” 

Raya studied her for a moment before replying. “You rely too much on movement. Magic is not in the hands, but in the intent. Your mind must be clear, your purpose sharp.” 

Celia took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and focused. She imagined a single flower, small and delicate, blooming with her magic. This time, she did not force it—she simply willed it. 

A soft glow formed around her fingers. The flower trembled… then bloomed. 

Celia’s eyes snapped open. “I—I did it!” 

Raya gave a slow nod of approval. “Indeed. A modest success, but a success nonetheless.” 

Celia beamed. “Thank you, Raya! You’re a great teacher.” 

Raya turned her head away slightly, but Celia didn’t miss the way her tail flicked—pleased, if only a little. “Do not grow complacent, child. There is much yet to learn.” 

Celia grinned. “Then I’ll keep practicing.” 

Raya tilted her head, watching Celia with a curious expression. “Perhaps… you are not entirely hopeless after all.” 

With that, they continued their lessons, an odd but undeniable partnership forming between the determined young witch and the regal feline who had begrudgingly become her mentor.
