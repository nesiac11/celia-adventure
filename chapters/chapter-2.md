# Chapter 2: The next day
<div class="decorative-line"></div>


The next day, Celia returned to the forest with her bag of treats. As she scattered food on the ground, a familiar voice called from above. 

"I see you enjoy feeding the strays." 

Celia’s face lit up. She looked up to find Raya perched on a high tree branch, peering down at her with mild disapproval. 

"Oh my gosh, it's you! Hi, Raya! Did you eat? Do you want some?" 

Raya twitched her ears, feigning indifference, though her nose betrayed her interest. "I suppose I could eat." 

Celia quickly set food on a flat tree stump, arranging it like a miniature table. "Is this better?" 

Raya eyed it, then nodded approvingly. "Thank you." With regal grace, she stepped forward and began eating delicately. 

Celia watched curiously. "So, do you like the name?" 

Raya didn’t look up from her meal. "It is tolerable." 

Celia grinned. "That means you love it." 

Raya let out a long-suffering sigh but didn’t argue. She finished her meal, licked her paw, and stood up. "Perhaps." With that, she turned and padded away, tail held high. 

Celia chuckled. "Cats will be cats," she murmured, already looking forward to their next meeting.
