# Chapter 4: Meowgic Lesson
<div class="decorative-line"></div>

 

A few days later, Celia stood in her backyard, surrounded by various magical ingredients and spell books. She was practicing her magic, but things weren’t going as smoothly as she’d hoped. No matter how hard she tried, her spells refused to behave, fizzling out before they could take shape. Frustration grew with each failed attempt. 

Just as she was about to give up, a familiar voice rang out from above. 

“Is that what you call magic?” Raya commented, perched gracefully on a wooden fence, her emerald eyes half-lidded with unimpressed amusement. 

Celia turned, startled. “Raya! You scared me.” 

Raya leapt down with effortless grace, landing softly beside her. “I merely arrived. It is not my fault that your senses are dull.” She tilted her head. “But truly, this display… It is almost painful to witness.” 

Celia flushed, frustration boiling over. “Well, excuse me! It’s not as easy as it looks!” 

Raya sniffed, tail flicking. “Magic is not meant to be easy. It is an art, a discipline. One cannot simply wave their hands about and expect wonders to unfold.” She extended a paw and, with a mere flick, caused the flowers nearby to bloom even brighter, as though they had been kissed by sunlight. 

Celia gasped. “You—you can do magic?!” 

Raya gave a slow blink, as if the question itself was insulting. “Child, did you truly believe me to be an ordinary talking cat?” 

Celia’s wonder turned to excitement. “Then… could you teach me?” 

Raya narrowed her eyes, considering. “My knowledge is vast and precious. I do not share it freely.” 

Celia’s face fell, but then she smirked. “Fine. Then no more special homemade cat food for you.” 

Raya’s ears twitched, and she stiffened. “What? You cannot be serious.” 

“Oh, I am.” Celia crossed her arms. “I give the strays food for free because they pay me with cuteness.” 

Raya scoffed, lifting her chin. “I am majestically cute.” 

“Not with that attitude,” Celia quipped. 

For the next few days, Celia stuck to her word. She continued feeding the strays, while Raya sulked—always watching from a distance, too proud to beg. 

Finally, after much silent brooding, Raya approached as Celia set down a fresh meal for the strays. 

“This is an outrage,” Raya declared. “You give food to these commoners, yet you demand payment from me?” 

Celia sighed, though amusement danced in her eyes. “Raya, it’s not about the food. It’s about you thinking I’m not capable of learning.” 

Raya went silent, her tail curling neatly around her paws. After a long pause, she sighed—a quiet, reluctant thing. “Very well, young witch. Perhaps I was hasty in my judgment.” She straightened, her regal air returning. “I shall teach you a few spells. But you must prove yourself worthy.” 

Celia grinned. “Really?! Thank you, Raya! I promise I won’t let you down.” 

Raya nodded solemnly. “We shall see. Now, let us begin with something simple.” 

And so, their lessons began.
